# Files for Generating Figures

System Requirements
--------------------
To run this code, you will need R and packages indicated in the code files in "require" or "install" statements and the data files described below. Code for generating figures was run using R version 4.0.2 on Windows 10 Home version 1909 with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz 1.99 GHz processor. Typical run time per file for generating figures is roughly less than 30 seconds.
